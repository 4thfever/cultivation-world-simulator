Title,Description
Introduction,This is a cultivation world where many cultivators compete to ascend.
Realm,"Cultivation realms from weak to strong: Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul. Each realm is divided into Early, Middle, and Late stages. The gap between realms is immense."
Lifespan,Every character has a lifespan. Exceeding it leads to death by old age. Advancing realms and certain treasures or elixirs can increase lifespan.
Death,You will also die if HP drops below 0.
Region,Different regions have different effects. Doing the right thing in the right region yields double the results with half the effort.
Cultivate,Cultivation increases experience until reaching a bottleneck. Breakthrough is probabilistic; success leads to the next realm.
Spiritual Root,Determines your affinity with spiritual Qi. Cultivating in a region matching your root (e.g., Fire Root in a Fire Abode) is most efficient.
Celestial Phenomenon,The world undergoes celestial changes (like Qi Tides) every few years, affecting character abilities.
Spirit Stones,The currency of the cultivation world. Used to buy artifacts and elixirs; obtained through harvesting, trading, or plundering.
Sect,A sanctuary for cultivators. Joining a sect grants unique techniques and protection; rogue cultivators are free but lack resources.
Combat,"Survival of the fittest. Realm suppression is massive; higher realms have absolute advantage. Winners can plunder the loser's belongings upon death."
Action,You have a series of actionable commands. Pay attention to effects, restrictions, regions, and time.
Equipment & Elixir,Weapons, auxiliary equipment, and elixirs provide stat bonuses. Owning good gear or taking high-quality elixirs brings great benefits.
Shopping,You can buy Qi Refinement level elixirs and weapons in City regions. Elixirs are consumed immediately for buffs. Buying weapons switches your weapon type.
Auction,Mysterious auctions occur at uncertain intervals, potentially offering rare goods.
