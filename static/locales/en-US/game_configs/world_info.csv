Title,Description
Introduction,This is a cultivation world where many cultivators compete to ascend.
Realm,"Cultivation realms from weak to strong: Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul. Each realm is divided into Early, Middle, and Late stages. The gap between realms is immense."
Lifespan,Every character has a maximum lifespan. In the 20 years before this limit, the body weakens, risking death by old age. Upon reaching or exceeding the limit, death is certain. Advancing realms and certain treasures or elixirs can increase maximum lifespan.
Death,You will also die if HP drops below 0.
Region,Different regions have different effects. Doing the right thing in the right region yields double the results with half the effort.
Cultivate,Cultivation increases experience until reaching a bottleneck. Breakthrough is probabilistic; success leads to the next realm.
Spiritual Root,Spiritual Roots are composed of the Five Elements (Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth), divided into Single, Dual, and Heavenly Spiritual Roots. The Five Elements suppress each other in a cycle: Gold suppresses Wood, Wood suppresses Earth, Earth suppresses Water, Water suppresses Fire, and Fire suppresses Gold. The Heavenly Spiritual Root contains all Five Elements and grants an additional breakthrough bonus. Cultivating in regions matching your root attributes is most efficient.
Celestial Phenomenon,The world undergoes celestial changes (like Qi Tides) every few years, affecting character abilities.
Spirit Stones,The currency of the cultivation world. Used to buy artifacts and elixirs; obtained through harvesting, trading, or plundering.
Sect,A sanctuary for cultivators. Joining a sect grants unique techniques and protection; rogue cultivators are free but lack resources.
Combat,"Survival of the fittest. Realm suppression is massive; higher realms have absolute advantage. Winners can plunder the loser's belongings upon death."
Action,You have a series of actionable commands. Pay attention to effects, restrictions, regions, and time.
Equipment & Elixir,Weapons, auxiliary equipment, and elixirs provide stat bonuses. Owning good gear or taking high-quality elixirs brings great benefits.
Shopping,You can buy Qi Refinement level elixirs and weapons in City regions. Elixirs are consumed immediately for buffs. Buying weapons switches your weapon type.
Auction,Mysterious auctions occur at uncertain intervals, potentially offering rare goods.
Hidden Domain,Hidden domains open every few years. Exploring them entails risks but may yield high-ranking artifacts and techniques.
