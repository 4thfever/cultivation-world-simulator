hidden_domain_wood,Remnant of Myriad Woods,"A fragment of the ancient Azure Emperor's Garden that shattered eons ago, now perpetually shrouded in multicolored, toxic miasma. The broken laws within cause spirit plants to grow madly, with shapeshifting demon vines and man-eating flowers lurking in the shadows. Rumor has it that if one can traverse the outer ""Dead Silence Forest"" and find the ""Azure Wood Spirit Spring"" at the core, even mortal grass can become immortal medicine. However, one must beware of the guardian beasts, twisted by millennia of consuming medicinal dregs, who thirst for fresh blood.",QI_REFINEMENT,0.3,0.3,0.2,5,0.05
hidden_domain_fire,Valley of Fallen Immortals,"The site where a human mighty figure perished together with the Flame Demon Emperor ten thousand years ago. To this day, the earth veins still spew unextinguishable Earthly Baleful Fire, dyeing the sky blood-red. Buried beneath the scorched earth are countless broken swords and halberds, and at midnight, battle souls roar, reenacting the tragic slaughter of the past. Training here requires enduring the constant pain of fire poison eroding the heart, but it is excellent for comprehending ancient battle intent. Those with deep destiny might even pick up fragment artifacts left by ancient cultivators from the magma depths or glimpse a trace of the Great Dao.",FOUNDATION_ESTABLISHMENT,0.4,0.4,0.15,10,0.03
hidden_domain_palace,Nine Heavens Void Palace,"A magnificent complex of palaces floating above the Nine Heavens Wind Layer. Only those with great perseverance can pass through the spatial rifts on the periphery that tear at the flesh. The interior is filled with ancient restrictions and layered illusion arrays; one wrong step means body and soul destruction, lost forever in the void. Although the Scripture Pavilion has collapsed over time, every page of the golden books and jade scrolls scattering in the void turbulence records supreme supernatural powers capable of causing a bloodbath in the cultivation world. Only peak Core Formation cultivators can barely withstand the pressure from the ancient times to spy a glimpse of immortal opportunity.",CORE_FORMATION,0.5,0.5,0.1,20,0.01
